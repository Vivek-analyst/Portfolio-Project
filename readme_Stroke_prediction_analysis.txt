Stroke Prediction Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my Stroke Prediction Machine Learning Project repository! In this project, I've explored and analyzed a dataset related to strokes and developed machine learning models to predict the occurrence of strokes based on various health and lifestyle factors.

Project Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: I started by cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis: I conducted a thorough analysis of the dataset, visualizing relationships between variables, identifying correlations, and spotting patterns that could influence stroke occurrence.

Feature Importance: Leveraging techniques like Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting, I determined which features play a crucial role in predicting strokes.

Handling Imbalanced Classes: Since stroke occurrence is rare, I addressed the class imbalance using resampling techniques like SMOTE and class weight balancing to improve model performance.

Model Building: I built and evaluated several machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression, to predict strokes. I also utilized appropriate evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Statistical Analysis: I performed statistical tests, such as chi-square and Cramer's V tests, to assess relationships between variables and their significance in predicting stroke occurrence.

GitHub Repository: You can find the code, notebooks, data, and other resources related to this project in this GitHub repository.

Project Goal:
The primary objective of this project was to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of stroke based on various health and lifestyle factors. By exploring and analyzing the dataset, handling challenges like class imbalance, and utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, I aimed to contribute insights into stroke prediction.
